I'm an undergraduate physics student at Sharif University of Technology, exploring different fields to find my future direction. My main interests are quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, and relativity. Currently, I'm working on a General Relativity project, while experimenting with different areas to see what excites me the most.  

If youâ€™re here, you probably have your own path in physics. Maybe our interests overlap.
